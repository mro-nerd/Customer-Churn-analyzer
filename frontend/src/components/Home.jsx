// FAQs data
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How accurate is the churn prediction model?",
    answer: "Our model typically achieves 70-90% accuracy depending on the quality and completeness of data. The model is regularly trained and validated to ensure optimal performance. You can view detailed model metrics in the Model Management section."
  },
  {
    question: "What customer data is required for predictions?",
    answer: "The model works best with a combination of demographic data (age, location), behavioral data (usage patterns, engagement), and transaction data (billing history, payment methods). For single predictions, you can input available data through our form. For batch predictions, we provide a template CSV file."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I run churn predictions?",
    answer: "For most businesses, running predictions monthly aligns well with billing cycles and provides enough time to implement retention strategies. However, for businesses with high transaction volumes or fast-changing customer behaviors, weekly predictions may be more appropriate."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my own historical data to train the model?",
    answer: "Yes! In the Model Management section, you can upload your historical customer data (including churn outcomes) to train a custom model. The system will compare performance between the default model and your custom model, allowing you to choose the best performer."
  },
  {
    question: "How should I prioritize customers for retention efforts?",
    answer: "Focus primarily on high-value customers with elevated churn risk (70%+) but who haven't reached a point of no return (95%+). Also consider the key factors driving their churn risk â€“ customers whose risk factors are more actionable should be prioritized."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between the churn probability and confidence score?",
    answer: "Churn probability indicates the likelihood of a customer churning, expressed as a percentage. The confidence score reflects how certain the model is about its prediction, based on data completeness and pattern recognition. Higher confidence scores mean more reliable predictions."
  },
  {
    question: "Can the system predict when a customer is likely to churn?",
    answer: "The current model focuses on identifying which customers are at risk rather than exactly when they might churn. However, the prediction typically indicates churn risk within the next 30-90 days based on the patterns identified."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I export prediction results?",
    answer: "For batch predictions, results are automatically available as a downloadable CSV file."

                  <h4>What is Customer Churn?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. 
                    This can be customers who cancel a subscription, close an account, or simply 
                    stop purchasing. Churn rate is the percentage of customers who leave during a 
                    given time period.

                  <h4>Why Churn Matters</h4>
                  <p>
                    Acquiring new customers can cost 5-25x more than retaining existing ones. 
                    A 5% increase in customer retention can increase profits by 25-95%. 
                    Understanding and reducing churn is critical for sustainable business growth.

                    MediaStream, a video subscription service, discovered through a Churn Prediction platform that 
                    customers who hadn't updated their viewing preferences in 60+ days were 3x more 
                    likely to churn. By implementing a preference refresh campaign with personalized 
                    content recommendations, they reduced churn by 22% in that segment.
